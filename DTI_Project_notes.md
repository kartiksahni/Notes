### 1. **Project Background & Objective:**
   - **Context:** Rising unsecured debt to income ratios were observed in the UK economy, which could potentially impact mortgage default rates.
   - **Objective:** To assess the relationship between DTI ratios and mortgage default rates and make recommendations on adjusting lending criteria, such as increasing the scorecard cutoff, to mitigate risk.

### 2. **Data Collection & Analysis:**
   - **Data Sources:** 
     - Historical mortgage portfolio data, including loan performance metrics.
     - DTI ratios at the time of mortgage origination.
     - Credit score data from applicants.
   - **Key Metrics Analyzed:**
     - Default rates at various DTI levels.
     - Application scores at the time of loan approval.

### 3. **Analytical Approach:**
   - **Segmentation:** Segment the mortgage portfolio based on DTI levels (e.g., 0-20%, 20-40%, etc.).
   - **Default Rate Analysis:** Calculate and compare default rates within each DTI segment.
   - **Scorecard Analysis:** Examine the credit scores of applicants within each DTI segment to identify correlations between score, DTI, and default rates.
   - **Trend Analysis:** Assess how the relationship between DTI and default rates evolved over time, considering macroeconomic factors.

### 4. **Findings:**
   - **Risk Identification:** Higher DTI levels were associated with increased default rates.
   - **Scorecard Cutoff Justification:** The existing scorecard cutoff may have been too lenient for applicants with high DTI, leading to a recommendation to increase the cutoff.

### 5. **Recommendations:**
   - **Increase Scorecard Cutoff:** Suggest raising the scorecard cutoff for mortgage applicants, especially those with higher DTI ratios.
   - **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement ongoing monitoring of DTI trends and default rates to make further adjustments as needed.
   - **Policy Adjustments:** Recommend potential policy changes to tighten lending criteria during periods of rising unsecured debt.

### 6. **Outcome:**
   - If possible, mention any follow-up actions or impacts that resulted from your recommendations, such as changes in the lending policy or improvements in the portfolio's risk profile.

### 7. **Presentation Tips:**
   - **Quantify Your Impact:** If available, use specific figures (e.g., reduction in default rates, percentage increase in scorecard cutoff) to illustrate the impact of your work.
   - **Show Thought Process:** Emphasize how you approached the problem analytically and used data to drive your recommendations.
   - **Be Prepared for Questions:** Be ready to discuss the methodologies you used, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.
