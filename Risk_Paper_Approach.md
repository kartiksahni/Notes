### 1. **Objective of the Analysis:**
   - **Risk Mitigation:** To assess how increasing the scorecard cut-off would reduce credit risk and associated provisions.
   - **Business Impact:** To evaluate the potential reduction in business volume due to stricter lending criteria.

### 2. **Key Credit Risk Metrics:**
   - **Probability of Default (PD):** The likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan.
   - **Loss Given Default (LGD):** The amount of loss if a borrower defaults, usually expressed as a percentage of the exposure at default.
   - **Exposure at Default (EAD):** The total value exposed to default at the time of potential default.
   - **Expected Loss (EL):** Calculated as \( \text{EL} = \text{PD} \times \text{LGD} \times \text{EAD} \).
   - **Provisions:** The reserves set aside to cover expected losses.

### 3. **Impact on Provisions:**
   - **Reduction in PD:** By increasing the scorecard cut-off, you're essentially reducing the proportion of high-risk borrowers approved for loans, which lowers the overall portfolio PD.
   - **Impact on Expected Loss:** Lower PD results in a lower expected loss, which reduces the need for provisions.
   - **Provision Calculation:** You may have used models that estimate the required provisions based on the portfolio’s PD, LGD, and EAD. The decrease in PD would directly lower the calculated provisions.

### 4. **Impact on Business Volume:**
   - **Approval Rates:** Stricter cut-offs typically reduce the number of approved applications, leading to a decrease in new business volume.
   - **Revenue Impact:** The reduction in business volume would lead to lower revenues from new loans. This could be estimated by calculating the expected volume reduction and multiplying it by the average loan size and interest margin.
   - **Profitability Analysis:** You likely performed a profitability analysis comparing the reduction in provisions (risk cost savings) against the potential loss in revenue.

### 5. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - **Baseline Scenario:** Current scorecard cut-off with existing PD, LGD, and EAD metrics.
   - **New Cut-Off Scenario:** Updated cut-off with recalculated PD, and subsequently, new provisions and business volume.
   - **Comparison:** Analyze the trade-off by comparing the expected loss and provisions in both scenarios against the reduction in business volume and profitability.

### 6. **Risk-Reward Trade-Off:**
   - **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Balance the reduction in credit risk (and hence provisions) with the potential impact on business volume and profitability.
   - **Strategic Recommendation:** Provide a recommendation on whether the increase in scorecard cut-off is justified based on the overall impact on the bank's risk profile and profitability.

### 7. **Presentation in the Risk Paper:**
   - **Data-Driven Insights:** Present the findings using data visualizations like charts or tables to illustrate the changes in PD, provisions, and business volume.
   - **Executive Summary:** Summarize the key takeaways, highlighting the risk reduction benefits and any significant impacts on business.

### 8. **Sensitivity Analysis (Optional):**
   - **Varying Cut-Off Levels:** You may have explored different cut-off levels to find an optimal balance, presenting the outcomes for different scenarios.
   - **Economic Conditions:** Consideration of how changes in the macroeconomic environment might affect these outcomes, providing a more robust analysis.

# Analyzing the Impact of Scorecard Cut-Off Changes

## Current Scenario:
- **Scorecard Cut-Off:** 600
- **Portfolio Size:** 10,000 loans
- **Average Loan Size:** £150,000
- **Current PD:** 2% (for the entire portfolio)
- **LGD:** 40% (assumed constant)
- **EAD:** £1.5 billion (Portfolio Size x Average Loan Size)

### Current Provisions:
- **Expected Loss (EL):**
  - EL = PD × LGD × EAD
  - EL = 2% × 40% × £1.5 billion = £12 million

- **Current Provisions:** £12 million (set aside to cover expected losses).

## New Scenario: Increased Cut-Off
- **New Scorecard Cut-Off:** 650
- **Impact on PD:** New PD reduced to 1.5% due to stricter lending criteria.
- **Impact on Approval Rates:** 15% reduction in approved applications (lower business volume).

### Revised Portfolio:
- **New Portfolio Size:** 8,500 loans (a 15% reduction)
- **New EAD:** £1.275 billion (8,500 loans × £150,000 average loan size)

### Revised Provisions:
- **New Expected Loss (EL):**
  - EL = 1.5% × 40% × £1.275 billion = £7.65 million

- **New Provisions:** £7.65 million (a reduction of £4.35 million from the current scenario).

## Business Impact:
- **Reduction in Loan Approvals:** 1,500 fewer loans (10,000 - 8,500).
- **Revenue Impact:** Assume an interest margin of 2% on loans.
  - Lost Revenue = 1,500 loans × £150,000 × 2% × 30 years = £13.5 million over the life of the loans
- **Annualized Impact:** 
  - Lost Revenue ≈ £450,000 per year

## Risk-Reward Trade-Off Analysis:
- **Provisions Reduction:** £4.35 million less in provisions, improving
